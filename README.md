# Personal Site

This repository powers my personal website, [thebriceisright.com](https://www.thebriceisright.com).

## Technology

While this website could easily have been made using good ol' HTML and CSS, I decided to use the opportunity of this rewrite to explore some newer tooling. I landed on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) due to its simplicity and out of the box support for all of my needs. I knew I wanted to work in [React](https://react.dev/) in case I decided to do anything fancy with state or context for theming purposes. I also knew I wanted to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which I used in a professional project about a year ago and was attracted to its speed of iteration.

I set up a simple deployment pipeline by connecting this repository to a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) project.


## Design
I could spend hours pouring over [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com) for inspiration. In that vein, I wanted to make something simple, clean, and modern.

## Roadmap
Eventually, I foresee showcasing some web experiments I've made over the years. But for this iteration, I wanted to simply get something up and running quickly and didn't have time to modernize my past projects. It would also be nice to add a light / dark theme for aesthetics / accessibility.
